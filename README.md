##Download and install

* [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/Mk1CargoBay/releases)
* CurseForge

From there, just unzip the "Mk1CargoBay" folder into your GameData directory.  Be sure to delete the old Mk1CargoBay if it's still around -- otherwise, the old PNG texture might stick around and cause trouble.

##Known and anticipated issues

None at this time.  Please let me know if you find any!

##Roadmap

##Credits

Thanks to Talisar for the models (caretaker releases by taniwha [over here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116849-104-talisar-parts-v100/) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/taniwha-qf/TalisarParts)), Roxette for the [initial release](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/104523-090-mk1-cargo-bay/), jlcarneiro for suggesting the Mk0 bay, and Master39 for the revised texture (I went back to the original interior rather than the gold/orange stuff, but the outside color looks much better).
